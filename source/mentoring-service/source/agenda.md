## Group Therapy

The meeting will be divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Discuss Submitted Work Challenges

Discuss up to five submitted work challenges, allocating 10-15 minutes to each challenge.
This provides an opportunity for members to share their experiences and discuss potential solutions to common work challenges.

### Part 2: Mentor-Selected Topics

Discuss one or more topics selected by the mentors, based on priority and time constraints.
This provides an opportunity for members to learn from the mentors and discuss topics of interest to the community.

## Mentor MeetUp

The meeting will be divided into four parts:

### Part 1: News

Cover program news and reports, including updates on lectures, meetings, and attendance. We will also provide a brief overview of each lecture and where to find its recording. Additionally, we will discuss any decisions and procedures that have been made in the program, such as transferring the profile to GitHub, updating the schedule, upcoming events, and so on.

### Part 2: Self-Introductions

Each of 3-4 members will introduce themselves. Each member will have 5-7 minutes to talk about their background, interests, and goals.

### Part 3: Why does this opinion show a wrong mindset?

Discuss some Facebook comments or real situations that demonstrate incorrect or limiting mindsets and use them as a learning opportunity to challenge and improve our own mindsets.

### Part 4: Program Updates (Group Advisory, Mentor for All, etc.)

Cover updates on various subprograms, including Group Advisory and Mentor for All. We will discuss any new features, developments, or changes to these programs, as well as any other relevant updates related to the program.
